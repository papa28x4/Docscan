# Docscan App

## Built with vanilla JS. I had just learnt of the File/Filereader Api. Decided to put that knowledge along with that of Regex to good use. 

### Features
 * Get total word and character counts
 * Get individual words sorted alphabetically, by number of occurrence or by word length
 * Find words using different search criteria
 * Replace a search term
